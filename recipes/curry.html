  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Easy, creamy Instant Pot Lentil Curry. Amazing Indian flavors, not too spicy, healthy, and vegan! One pot recipe that's completely hands free.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups lentils <i>green or brown</i></li>
    <li>1/2 tablesspoon coconut oil</li>
    <li>1 cup plus 1 tablespoon water <i>divided</i></li>
    <li>1 small shallot <i>finely chopped</i></li>
    <li>3 tablesspoons minced fresh ginger</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic <i>about 6 cloves</i></li>
    <li>1 tablespoon curry powder <i>plus 1 teaspoon</i></li>
    <li>1/2 tablespoon coconut sugar <i>or brown sugar</i></li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li> 3/4 teaspoon ground tumeric</li>
    <li>1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 can light coconut milk <i>14 ounces</i></li>
    <li>2 tablespoons lemon or lime juice</li>
    <li>Cooked brown rice <i>for serving</i></li>
    <li>Chopped fresh cilantro</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Rinse and drain the lentils, then set aside. Set the Instant Pot to sauté and add the coconut oil. Once the oil has melted, add 1 tablespoon water, the shallot, ginger, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until very fragrant and the shallot is soft, about 2 minutes. Add the curry powder, coconut sugar, salt, turmeric, and cayenne and stir vigorously. Stand back and try not to breath in any of the steam coming from the pot (it's spicy!). Add the lentils, coconut milk, and 1 cup of water. Stir to coat the lentils completely with the liquid.</li>
    <li>Hit cancel to stop the sauté function, seal the lid, then set to cook on HIGH pressure for 15 minutes. (It will take about 8 minutes for the pressure to build, then the timer will begin.) Once the timer has stopped, let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then vent to release the pressure completely. Open the lid and stir in the lemon juice. Taste and adjust the seasoning as desired. If the curry is too thick, add a bit more water to loosen as needed. Serve hot with rice, sprinkled with cilantro.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 4 to 5 days or freeze for 2 to 3 months. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator. The lentils thicken as they cool, so to reheat, sprinkle with a little water, vegetable or chicken stock, or coconut milk, then rewarm gently in the microwave or on the stovetop, adding more liquid as needed.
    </li>
    <li>I do not recommend using red or yellow lentils in the Instant Pot, as their texture is more delicate and they tend to fall apart.</li>
    <li>To make on the stove: Cook the lentils (you can use any kind of lentils you like). In a separate large, rimmed skillet, sauté the shallot, ginger, garlic, and spices as directed over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, then add the coconut milk and coconut sugar. Let simmer gently for 4 to 5 minutes, until slightly thickened. Stir in the lemon juice and cooked lentils.</li>
  </ul>
